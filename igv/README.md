- `4cond_dml.bed`:

- `DEG_sex_filtered_p-0.05_q-0.05.bed`: BED file of differentially expressed genes (DEG) identified between sexes, filtered for DEG having p-values and q-values <= 0.05. Includes optional
columns 4 (`name`), 5 (`score`), and 6 (`strand`). The `name` column is the transcript ID assigned by `ballgown`. The `score` column has been assigned an arbitrary value of 0.

- `DET_sex_filtered_p-0.05_q-0.05.bed`: BED file of differentially expressed transcripts (DET) identified between sexes, filtered for DET having p-values and q-values <= 0.05. Includes optional
columns 4 (`name`), 5 (`score`), and 6 (`strand`). The `name` column is the transcript ID assigned by `ballgown`. The `score` column has been assigned an arbitrary value of 0.
